# TestQL

API testing focuses testing library.


#### Summary

After years of web development I gathered a list of 
requirements about how should an API testing library to be. These are;

* It should be agile. You shouldn't spend too much time to create a test case
* it should be flexible, each project has different requirements.
* It should be able to work as standalone, no need to worry about dependencies and conflicts.
* It should be able to work without installing, it will run with one single docker command
* It should handle by its own authentication, almost all of the projects you will need to run tests with different accounts.
